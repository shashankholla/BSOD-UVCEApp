# Motivation

- Per an Economic Times report, Indiaâ€™s smartphone penetration rate has risen from 9% in 2015 to 25% in 2018. Rural India saw a growth of 34% in one year.
- Covid 19 Pandemic, youth unemployment has increased in the unorganised sectors 
- Consumer applications for sectors such as hospitality (Oyo, Swiggy, Zomato) exists but no application for sectors like construction, farming, agriculture etc.
- This motivated us to  design an application that would connect employers with daily wage workers.
- We were also acutely aware of the educational background of such labourers and we felt that for our application to reach a wider audience it was absolutely necessary that we make it available in regional languages.

# Working

- In the beginning users are requested to sign into the app through a mobile and otp based login. This is done to avoid spam account creation.
- Once you login for the first time, users must select between an employer and labourer. Depending on what kind of user they are. 
- Employers are given the option to add new works in the location of their choice and the job listing is posted onto the database for labourers to view.
- Labourers within close proximity are given updates regarding the jobs near them for which they can apply. Then, it is upto the employer to accept or decline the labourer who has applied.
- Once both parties agree, in app messaging is enabled for them to communicate with each other and the work can proceed.

# Rating system

- In a measure to make sure that quality workers meet quality employers we have come up with a rating mechanism similar to the one used in chess.
- Right now we have a basic rating system where employers rate their workers after a job is completed.
- Based on the rating a worker received, they are placed on a curve that determines which region they belong to. 
- The better your place on the curve the better is the nature of jobs you receive. The rating system allows the workers to excel and get better opportunities

# Monetisation

- If we are to earn some revenue from this application, we are planning to take a small commission (10-15%) of every successful job completed to help boost further application development and innovation.
- Further, we plan to use the skilled labour force and provide them with low cost certification courses that will help them stand out in the job market and help them to grow as well.
- Based on user engagement with the app and the nature of spending, we can try for targeted advertising and help other brands grow.
